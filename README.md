## Generalized Neural Graph Embedding with Matrix Factorization

This project contains code related to the paper "Generalized Neural Graph Embedding with Matrix Factorization".
G2-EMF is a graph/network embedding method that can incorporate the structure information,
content information and label information simultaneously in an unsupervised manner, i.e.,
without leveraging downstream classifiers.
G2-EMF outperforms unsupervised baselines from 10.1% to 34.4% on the node classification task.
